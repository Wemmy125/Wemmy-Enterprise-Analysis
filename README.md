Transfer payments and key clients (Citigroup, Costco) are major revenue drivers, with location-based profitability highlighting New York as the top market. Payment method clarity (e.g., Netflix) could improve data accuracy.

##  Recommendations & Conclusions
###  Key Recommendations
-  Focus on High-Value Clients – Prioritize Citigroup, Costco, and Dell, as they drive the most revenue. Strengthen relationships and explore upsell opportunities.
-  Expand Transfer Payment Adoption – Since transfers generate 3x more revenue than cards/checks, incentivize more clients to use this method.
-  Optimize Regional Strategy – New York, Texas, and California are top profit centers; allocate more resources to these markets.
-  Improve Data Tracking – Capture missing payment details (e.g., Netflix) to ensure complete financial analysis.
-  Leverage Seasonal Trends – May had peak revenue; plan targeted promotions or campaigns around this period next year.

##  Conclusion
By optimizing transfer payment methods, refining client focus, and enhancing data tracking, profitability can be further improved.
Strategic regional investments and seasonal adjustments will help sustain growth.
